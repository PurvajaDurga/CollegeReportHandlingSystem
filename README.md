## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Front End– HTML, CSS and Javascript


### HTML: </br>
In this project HTML was used in the front end to create web pages. HTML was used. Through HTML the following pages were created:</br>
Home page- which displayed all the options that the end user can click on. </br>
Employee page- Which in turn had employee login page and employee register page which were created with HTML. </br>

JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. </br>
Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript. </br>


## Middleware – JSP

### JSP:
In this project, JSP was used to create login, register pages and so on. It is mainly used to get establish a connection with the database and store the necessary. JSP is a file extension for Java Server Pages file format. A JSP is an HTML page containing a reference to Java servlets, or, java server side applets. JSP files help to deliver server side customized content on a webpage through servlets.
A JavaServer Pages component is a type of Java servlet that is designed to fulfill the role of a user interface for a Java web application. Web developers write JSPs as text files that combine HTML or XHTML code, XML elements, and embedded JSP actions and commands.

### Backend – Oracle
Oracle:A database server also prevents unauthorized access and provides efficient solutions for failure recovery. Oracle Database is the first database designed for enterprise grid computing, the most flexible and cost effective way to manage information and applications. Oracle database is a collection of physical operating system files or disks (in the simplest terms). Oracle instance is set of Oracle background processes or threads and a shared memory area, which is memory that is shared across those threads or processes running on a single computer.

### IDE – Eclipse
Eclipse:The entire project was done using Eclipse IDE which was useful for html pages, jsp pages. In the context of computing, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing applications using the Java programming language and other programming languages such as C/C++,Pythonetc.	Eclipse can be used as an IDE for anyprogramming
language for which a plug-in is available.


### Web server – Apache Tomcat 7
Apache Tomcat 7: The Apache Tomcatsoftware is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet,JavaServerPages.Apache Tomcat is used to deploy your Java Servlets and JSPs. So in your Java project you can build your WAR file, and just drop it in the deploy directory in Tomcat. So basically Apache is an HTTP Server, serving HTTP. Tomcat is a Servlet and JSP Server serving Java technologies.



### Development Kit – JDK 1.7
JDK 1.7: The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
